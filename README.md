Welcome to my hands-on cybersecurity and IT portfolio. I specialize in **threat hunting, detection engineering, and vulnerability management**, building practical labs that simulate real-world attacks and defensive scenarios. Each project reflects my focus on developing analyst-level skills across modern security operations, cloud environments, and detection workflows.

I’m passionate about continuously improving my defensive mindset by recreating attacker behaviors and building detections that strengthen real-world security posture.
