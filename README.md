Welcome to my hands-on cybersecurity and IT portfolio. I specialize in **threat hunting, detection engineering, and vulnerability management**, building practical labs that simulate real-world attacks and defensive scenarios. Each project reflects my focus on developing analyst-level skills across modern security operations, cloud environments, and detection workflows.

I’m passionate about continuously improving my defensive mindset by recreating attacker behaviors and building detections that strengthen real-world security posture.

## 🏢 Active Directory & Enterprise Labs

- **[Active Directory Enterprise Lab (VMware)](https://github.com/donaldhessportfolio/VMware-Active-Directory-Group-Policy/tree/main)**  
  Built a fully functional on-premises Active Directory lab using Windows Server 2022 in VMware, simulating a real enterprise environment. Configured domain services, organizational units, users, and group policies including account lockout protections and security baselines. Implemented domain-joined endpoints to emulate real-world authentication flows and administrative workflows. Designed the environment for security testing, detection engineering, and future SOC simulations such as brute-force detection, privilege escalation scenarios, and log-based investigations.

## ⚠️ Vulnerability Management

- **[Vulnerability Management Program Implementation](https://github.com/donaldhessportfolio/Vulnerability-Management-Program)**  
  Built a full lifecycle vulnerability management workflow including discovery, prioritization, remediation strategy, and reporting aligned with enterprise security practices.

## 🕵️ Honeypots & Detection Engineering

- **[Azure Honeypot Lab – Brute Force & Internet Scanning Analysis](https://github.com/donaldhessportfolio/Azure-SOC-Telemetry-Detection-Lab-Honeypot-Observation-/tree/main)**  
  Deployed an internet-facing Azure honeypot to analyze real-world brute force traffic, attacker behavior, and telemetry patterns using Microsoft security tooling.

## 🚨 Threat Hunting & Security Operations

- **[Threat Hunting Scenario (Tor Browser Usage)](https://github.com/donaldhessportfolio/Threat-Hunting-Scenario-Tor-Browser-Usage-/tree/main)**  
  Investigated suspicious TOR usage across endpoints using Defender telemetry and KQL-based threat hunting workflows.

- **[Threat Hunt – Crosscheck](https://github.com/donaldhessportfolio/Threat-Hunt-Crosscheck)**  
  Multi-phase investigation simulating enterprise data theft, including lateral movement analysis, staged exfiltration detection, and behavioral correlation across multiple hosts.
